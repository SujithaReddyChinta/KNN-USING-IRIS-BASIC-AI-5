K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It makes predictions based on the majority class or average value of the k nearest data points in the feature space. KNN's decision-making process relies on distance metrics like Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance. It's non-parametric and lazy-learning, meaning it doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution and doesn't learn a discriminative function during training. While KNN is easy to understand and implement, its performance can be sensitive to the choice of k and the distance metric, and it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
